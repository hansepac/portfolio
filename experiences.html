                <h2>Math Tutor</h2>
                <p class="experiences-mt-p">As a Math Tutor, I learned how to work with people from all walks of life, discern their understanding and needs, and tailor my teaching to meet those needs in an enthusiastic and enjoyable way. By the end of my time tutoring, I had helped over 100 students improve their final grades by approximately 12%. Students would specifically request me even when other tutors were available because of my ability to teach well and uplift them.</p>

                <h3>District Leader</h3>            
                <p>I served as a district leader in two different areas for a total of 7 months. I planned and led district councils, prepared and gave powerful, tailored training, and learned and met the needs of each missionary by working with them, calling them, and checking up on their goals.</p>

                <h3>Zone Leader</h3>
                <p>I served as a zone leader in two different areas for a total of 8.5 months. It was here that I learned how to lead and inspire my district leaders so they could lead and inspire their missionaries. I learned that the best leaders are the best followers, and walk side by side those they lead. I conducted zone conferences, planned zone trainings, lead zone initiatives tailored to help the zone grow in its weakest areas. By the time I was done, I had served 60+ missionaries, and increased zone statistics by approximately 30%.</p>
